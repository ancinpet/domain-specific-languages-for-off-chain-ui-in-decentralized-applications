# Domain-Specific Languages for Off-chain UI in Decentralized Applications
My master thesis - Domain-Specific Languages for Off-chain UI in Decentralized Applications

Created for the CCMi research group. https://ccmi.fit.cvut.cz/en/

There are two applications developed as part of the thesis. Both use the Blazor framework.
A form designer for smart contract flows (creates a FE model) and a form interpret (renders the FE model and allows user to interact with smart contracts).
Both applications are also available separately:
